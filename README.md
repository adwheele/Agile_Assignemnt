This application is a tickmanagement software, where you can sign in or create a user, input and edit an issue you are having with with a company device or software and a support technicion would read it and email you to get it resolved then they would sign in as an admin and delete the ticket if it is resolved.

to sign in the defult accounts are:
----------------------------------
Username               Password
Admin		               Admin
Admin2		             pa$$word
User1		               User1
User2		               User2
-----------------------------------

When creating a new account the username can only be letters A to Z upper or lowercase and any numbers, no special characters (!"Â£$%^&*()@:[}~[
Additionally if you set the password of any username to ("pa$$word" <== Case sensitive) then it creates an admin account.

After signing in navigate to the ticketmanager page, there are some sample data to modify or delete and an option to create a new ticket.

To modify or delete, type in the ID number you want to change, seen at the start of every ticker, and based on wether you are an admin or regular
user you will have the option to modify or both modify and delete.

If modify is selected it shows the ticket you wanted to modify and type in what you want to change and press submit.

Delete is simpler just press ok or cancel when you get a prompt.

if you go to the login page, createuser page or click logout, you will need to sign in again before being able to access any other page.
